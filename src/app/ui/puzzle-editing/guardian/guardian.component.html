<h3>Guardian and Observer Puzzles</h3>

<p class="mt-3">
    I am curretnly experiencing a problem downloading puzzles automatically from the Guardian Media websites.
    This includes the Guardian cryptics, Azed and Everymam. Until I can find out why requests to the Guardian
    websites
    are being refused you will need to download these puzzles manually.

            To open a Guardian/Observer puzzle:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="mt-3">Go to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords" target="_blank">The Guardian website</a>
                and find the puzzle you want</li>
            <li class="mt-3"><div>
                Find and click the link named <b>PDF Version</b>
                <img class="d-block mt-2" src="/assets/pdflink.png">
            </div></li>
            <li class="mt-3">In your PDF viewer save (or download) the file to your local hard drive</li>
            <li class="mt-3">Once you have downloaded the PDF file click the <b>Open a PDF</b> button below and follow the instructions</li>
        </ol>
    </ngb-alert>

<div class="mt-3">

            <b>NOTE:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Guardian Quiptic</b> does not have a PDF Version link.
        </p>
        <p>
            To download the Quiptic you will need to follow the <b>Print</b> link and then download the following page as a PDF using your browser's
            built-in PDF tool.  How you do this varies from browser to browser.
