            I am curretnly experiencing a problem downloading puzzles automatically from the Guardian Media websites.
            This includes the Guardian Cryptic, Azed and Everymam. Until I can find out why requests to the Guardian
            websites
            are being refused you will need to download these puzzles manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            The steps to do this are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords" target="_blank">The Guardian website</a>
                and find the puzzle you want</li>
            <li>Find and click the link named <b>PDF Version</b></li>
            <li>In your PDF viewer save (or download) the file to your local hard drive</li>
            <li>Once you have downloaded the PDF file go to the <b>Open PDF page</b> and follow the instructions</li>
        </ul>
    </app-info-panel>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <div>I want to load a puzzle from a PDF file on my computer</div>
    <button class="btn btn-primary mt-3" (click)="onPdf()">Open a PDF</button>
</div>

            NOTE: a better way to get a Guardian PDF is to click the <b>Print</b> link rather then the <b>PDF
                Version</b> link.
            If you do this then you will need to save the print page as a PDF using your browser's built-in PDF
            converter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advantage of this method is that Print version of the puzzle does not contain the previous week's
            solutions and various other extraneous text that is present in the normal PDF download.
            The presence of this extra text makes it hard for my app to distinguish between the real clues and the other
            text.
