        I am curretnly experiencing a problem downloading puzzles automatically from the Guardian Media websites.  
        This includes the Guardian Cryptic, Azed and Everymam.  Until I can find out why requests to the Guardian websites
        are being refused you will need to download these puzzles manually.
    </p>
    <p>
        The steps to do this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords" target="_blank">The Guardian website</a> 
            and find the puzzle you want</li>
        <li>Find and click the link named <b>PDF Version</b></li>
        <li>In your PDF viewer save (or download) the file to your local hard drive</li>
        <li>Once you have downloaded the PDF file go to the <b>Open PDF page</b> and follow the instructions</li>
    </ul>
